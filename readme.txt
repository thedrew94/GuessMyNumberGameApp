(Java Script) Here's a breakdown of what the code is doing:

This app is a number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly
generated number between 1 and 20 within a certain number of tries. 
The player starts with a score of 20 and their score decreases by 1 
with each incorrect guess. 
If the player correctly guesses the secret number, 
they win the game and their score is compared to the highscore. 
The player can then play the game again by clicking the "play again" 
button, which resets the secret number and score to their 
default values.
